## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this challenge, I started thinking of using CSS Grid, but found out that it was better to think in just one direction for the most part, so I went with Flexbox once again. It was a bit of a challenge to be honest, since the positioning of several elements was not something I had dealt before.

### Useful resources

- [the :nth-child() CSS pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child) - This helped me to style the position of the cards and star ratings in a way I didn't use before. It was pretty nice to know about it and use it.
