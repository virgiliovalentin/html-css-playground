## My process

I first began structuring semantically the card content, also using classes and making sure they were reusable. Then, I started to tackle the desing, beginning with the mobile view and then adapting it to desktop view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I really got to put to work my Flexbox knowledge! I still have a long way to go with it (some issues when zooming out in desktop view) but I am happy with how it turned out. I also got to work with CSS variables and it really helps a lot when using the same property over and over again.

### Continued development

As I already mentioned, I still need to work on getting Flexbox right. Something happened when zooming out the webpage in desktop view that instead of shrinking the card, elongates the width and I still haven found a way to fix it. I would also like to keep working on my CSS and start using SASS, for example.

### Useful resources

- [A Guide To Flexbox by CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This was really helpful to understand and check the Flexbox properties for the container and the items.
- [This coding video of the same challenge by Thomas Sankara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tlbKm8_4mg&t=951s) - I needed some kind of visual boost to understand how to start tackling the challenge and I found this video really useful.
