## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this challenge, I finally got to work with CSS Grid. It wasn't as easy I thought it would be, but I'd like to think it ended up fairly okay. I tried going with a desktop-first approach and then applying a few lines of code to make it responsive, but I couldn't quite understand those concepts, so I went with Grid for the desktop view and Flexbox for the mobile one, since it was just one column and Flexbox works well when working with only one direction.

### Continued development

I would really like to keep practicing my Grid skills. I've looked up ways to work responsive with it, but I couldn't quite work it, so I would like to keep working on that.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me to understand Grid better.
- [CSS Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/) - This is an amazing website that shows different ways Grid can be used with examples that are easy to understand.
