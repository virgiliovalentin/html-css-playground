## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenged helped me to keep working on my Flexbox skills. I found it easier than my first Frontend Mentors challege and I believe I got the hang of fixing the sizing of the container when zooming out, which I had trouble with on my first challenge.

### Continued development

I want to keep using Flexbox, but I'll dabble in CSS Grid to check how I can handle a project with that. 

### Useful resources

- [Bluuweb's live coding video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe_qNR1mmCg) - This really helped me to get some extra understanding on some concepts, even though I didn't use SASS in this project.
