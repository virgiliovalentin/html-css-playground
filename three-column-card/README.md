## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was another challenge where I put my Flexbox skills to test. I began visualizing the layout with CSS Grid, but found out that Flexbox was better suited and a bit easier to work with this design. I think I learned how to fix my previous error where zooming out on desktop view just made the container larger. I fixed it by setting a width as well as a height value, which I usually think it's either one or the other, but in this case helped me to fix that.
